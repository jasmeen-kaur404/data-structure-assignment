    "String slicing is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to extract substrings from a string by specifying a start and end index. The syntax for slicing is:\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the parameters:\n",
    "start: The index where the slice begins (inclusive).\n",
    "end: The index where the slice ends (exclusive).\n",
    "step: The step size or stride (optional), which determines the increment between indices in the slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Basic Slicing:\n",
    "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "substring = text[0:5]\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "print(my_list[0])  # Output: 10\n",

    "#Discuss the use cases og tuples and sets in Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python programming, tuples and sets serve distinct purposes due to their unique characteristics. Here’s an overview of their use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Tuples\n",
    "1. Immutable Data Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed. This makes them ideal for fixed collections of items that should not be altered, such as configuration settings or fixed data points.\n",
    "Use Case Example: Storing geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude), where values are not meant to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "location = (37.7749, -122.4194)  # San Francisco coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hashable Data Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Because tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets, unlike lists. This is useful for creating compound keys or storing immutable data.\n",
    "Use Case Example: Using tuples as dictionary keys for storing multiple attributes of an item.\n",
    "\n",
    "item_prices = {('apple', 'green'): 0.50, ('banana', 'yellow'): 0.30}\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Returning Multiple Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions often use tuples to return multiple values from a single return statement, making it easier to manage and unpack results.\n",
    "Use Case Example: A function that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "def calculate_rectangle_properties(width, height):\n",
    "    area = width * height\n",
    "    perimeter = 2 * (width + height)\n",
    "    return (area, perimeter)\n",
    "\n",
    "properties = calculate_rectangle_properties(5, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Fixed Data Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples can be used to represent a fixed structure of data, such as a record or a row from a database, where each field is expected to have a specific meaning.\n",
    "Use Case Example: Representing a person’s name, age, and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "person = (\"Alice\", 30, \"Female\")\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Efficient Data Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are generally more memory efficient and faster to create and access compared to lists, especially for small, fixed collections of items.\n",
    "Use Case Example: Storing a small number of elements in a performance-critical application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Sets\n",
    "1. Removing Duplicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets automatically enforce uniqueness, making them ideal for removing duplicate elements from a collection.\n",
    "Use Case Example: Extracting unique items from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n",
    "unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Membership Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets provide fast membership testing using the in operator due to their underlying hash table implementation, which is more efficient than lists for large collections.\n",
    "Use Case Example: Checking if an item exists in a collection of allowed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "allowed_values = {10, 20, 30}\n",
    "print(25 in allowed_values)  # Output: False\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mathematical Set Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, which are useful for tasks involving comparisons between collections.\n",
    "Use Case Example: Finding common elements between two sets of user IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "users_active = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "users_inactive = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "common_users = users_active & users_inactive\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are useful when you need to ensure that no duplicate entries are allowed, such as when processing data or aggregating unique values.\n",
    "Use Case Example: Tracking unique visitors to a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "visitor_ids = set()\n",
    "visitor_ids.add(101)\n",
    "visitor_ids.add(102)\n",
    "visitor_ids.add(101)  # Duplicate, will be ignored\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Set Comprehensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets can be created using set comprehensions, which allow for concise and readable construction of sets based on existing iterables or conditions.\n",
    "Use Case Example: Creating a set of even numbers from a range.\n",

    "Importance of Dictionary Keys Being Immutable\n",
    "Hashing:\n",
    "Dictionaries in Python are implemented using hash tables. This data structure uses hash functions to map keys to specific locations in memory, which allows for efficient retrieval of values.\n",
    "For the hash table to work correctly, the key’s hash value must remain constant during its lifetime. If keys were mutable and their hash values could change, it would break the hash table's consistency, leading to unpredictable behavior and data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency:\n",
    "Immutable keys ensure that the dictionary remains in a consistent state. If a key's value could change, it might affect the hash and thus disrupt the dictionary's ability to retrieve or update the associated value. This could lead to data loss or incorrect data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity:\n",
    "Using immutable keys maintains the integrity of the data structure. Since the key’s value cannot be altered, the association between the key and its corresponding value remains reliable throughout the program.\n",
    "Examples of Immutable and Mutable Keys\n",
    "Immutable Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers, Strings, and Tuples (if all elements of the tuple are also immutable) are examples of immutable types that can be used as dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Using integers as dictionary keys\n",
    "number_dict = {1: \"one\", 2: \"two\"}\n",
    "print(number_dict[1])  # Output: one\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using strings as dictionary keys\n",
    "string_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}\n",
    "print(string_dict[\"name\"])  # Output: Alice\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using tuples as dictionary keys\n",
    "tuple_dict = {(\"x\", \"y\"): \"coordinates\", (1, 2, 3): \"numbers\"}\n",
    "print(tuple_dict[(\"x\", \"y\")])  # Output: coordinates\n",
    "Mutable Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and Sets are mutable types and cannot be used as dictionary keys because their contents can change, leading to potential issues with hash consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Attempting to use a list as a dictionary key\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    invalid_dict = {[1, 2, 3]: \"list\"}\n",
    "except TypeError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)  # Output: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Attempting to use a set as a dictionary key\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    invalid_dict = {frozenset([1, 2]): \"set\"}\n",
    "except TypeError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)  # Output: unhashable type: 'set'\n",
    "Why Immutability Matters\n",
    "Hash Table Stability: Since dictionary keys are used to compute hash values, immutable keys ensure that these hash values do not change, which maintains the stability of the hash table.\n",
    "Data Integrity: Immutable keys protect the data from being altered in ways that would affect the hash value, thus preserving the integrity and consistency of the dictionary."
